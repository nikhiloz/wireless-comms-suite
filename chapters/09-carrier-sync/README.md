# Chapter 09 — Carrier Synchronisation

## Objective
Correct frequency and phase offsets between transmitter and receiver local oscillators.

## Key Concepts
- **Costas Loop**: Squaring-based carrier recovery for BPSK/QPSK
- **PLL**: Phase-locked loop tracks carrier phase
- **Frequency offset**: Residual CFO after down-conversion
- **Loop bandwidth**: Trade-off between acquisition speed and noise rejection
