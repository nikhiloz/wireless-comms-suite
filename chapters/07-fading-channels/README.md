# Chapter 07 — Fading Channels

## Objective
Model wireless propagation effects: flat/frequency-selective fading, multipath, Doppler.

## Key Concepts
- **Rayleigh**: No LOS — envelope is Rayleigh-distributed
- **Rician**: LOS + scattered — K-factor controls ratio
- **Multipath**: Tapped delay line (TDL) model
- **Doppler shift**: f_d = v·f_c/c — time-varying channel
