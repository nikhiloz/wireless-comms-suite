WIRELESS-COMMS-SUITE: PROJECT OUTLINE

Style: Follows https://github.com/nikhiloz/dsp-tutorial-suite (C code only, no Python/other languages)
Purpose: Bridge between SDR_Notes (SDR theory, hardware/software, protocols) and dsp-tutorial-suite (DSP concepts, C implementations)
Distinction: Focuses on practical wireless communication systems, protocol stacks, and real-world applications, with C code for all layers.

PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Phase 1: Foundations & Architecture
	- Overview of wireless communication systems (block diagrams, signal flow)
	- Basic transmitter/receiver structure in C
	- Channel models (AWGN, fading, interference) in C
	- Project structure: chapters/, include/, src/, tests/, reference/

Phase 2: Protocols & Standards
	- Implement core wireless standards (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, Cellular)
	- MAC/PHY layer code examples (frame formats, channel access, modulation)
	- Protocol stack demos (packet encoding/decoding, state machines)

Phase 3: Applications & Integration
	- End-to-end wireless links (transmitter, channel, receiver)
	- IoT and mesh network examples
	- Real-world integration: hardware interfacing, test utilities
	- Spectrum management and monitoring tools

Phase 4: Advanced Topics & Bridge
	- Bridging SDR and DSP: integrating SDR hardware with protocol stacks
	- DSP for wireless: filtering, demodulation, error correction in C
	- Multi-protocol coexistence, advanced channel models
	- Capstone projects: complete wireless system demos

Each phase will include:
	- Theory (README.md, diagrams)
	- C code (demo.c, library modules)
	- Tests (unit tests, integration tests)
	- Reference (API docs, protocol specs)

This outline ensures wireless-comms-suite is a practical, C-based bridge between SDR_Notes and dsp-tutorial-suite, with clear phased development.
